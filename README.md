# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Analysis
The Breast Cancer Prediction project focuses on the classification of breast masses as malignant or benign. It utilizes a dataset comprising features extracted from digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. These features offer insights into cell nuclei characteristics.

Dataset Information:

ID Number: Unique sample identifier.
Diagnosis: Target variable ('M' for malignant, 'B' for benign).
Features: Ten real-valued measurements, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
These features enable quantitative assessment of cell nuclei, aiding in the distinction between malignant and benign masses. By training machine learning models on this dataset, we aim to create a tool for early breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
